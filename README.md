# Note to myself

Use my notes from Notion fist

If I don't find the answer there, then look into the lectures on Kitt

If I don't find the answer there, then look here or in my code for the daily challenges

# Note to others

This is not code to be shared

These are just quick-and-dirty notes (as opposed to my nice-and-beautifull notes on Notion)

So don't re-use it, it probably won't make much sense to you anyway
